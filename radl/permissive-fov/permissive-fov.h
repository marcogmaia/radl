  The struct permissiveMaskT is used to specify the area around the
  source square which should be visited and the shape of that
  square. It provides a way to specify a (potentially asymmetric) box
  around the player which is used to bound the computation of FoV. And
  then it provides a way to specify which squares inside of that box
  to actually visit. This can be used to, for instance, provide
  different FoV depending on facing, or to cause FoV to be bounded by
  an approximation of a circle rather than a rectangle.

  Even if a map square has been marked as 'do not visit', that square
  passes visibility (or not) as normal, and isBlocked() may be called
  on it.
